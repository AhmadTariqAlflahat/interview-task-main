- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
A Z-score answers the question “How many standard deviations is this data point from the 
mean?” Example: The mean is 100, the standard deviation is 4, and a data value of 92 has Z-score -2.

In Min-Max Scaling answers the qeustion "How much data is influenced by the maximum and minimum 
values?" Example: When the input value is somewhat large, the output value easily reaches the 
max value of 1.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
Test cases are mock situations that validate your project's building blocks.
How would you ensure that every brick in a wall is solid if you were constructing one? If you
do an examination after the wall is built, first of all, it's really tough to find out since 
they're all connected, and second, even if you do, how much will it cost to change it? There's 
a danger that while replacing the faulty bricks, you'll shatter other nearby bricks.
